\title{Summarise STRUCTURE runs}
\usage{
summariseRunsStructure(data = NULL, writetable = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with tabulated runs. An output from
\code{tabulateRunsStructure()}. Must have minimum 4 columns named k, ind, loci and elpd.}

\item{writetable}{A logical indicating if the output table is to be exported as a tab-delimited text file in the working directory.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with all values of K sorted by loci, ind and K. The table has
6 columns namely mean estimated ln probability of data, standard deviation,
value of K, Number of runs for each K, number of individuals, number of loci,
estimated ln probability of data plus standard deviation, estimated ln
probability of data minus standard deviation.
}
\description{
Creates a summary table of several STRUCTURE runs with means and std deviation. Refer to return for detailed list of columns.
