\usage{
tabulateRunsTess(files = NULL, writetable = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{files}{A character vector of TESS cluster files to

  interactive selection. Use \code{collectRunsTess()} to
  collect TESS runs from multiple folders into one.}

  \item{writetable}{Set to FALSE by default. Setting to
  TRUE writes the output table as a tab-delimited text file
  in the same folder as the STRUCTURE run files.}

  \item{quiet}{If set to TRUE, then number of selected
  files are not printed.}
}
