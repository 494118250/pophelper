\title{Tabulate TESS runs}
\usage{
tabulateRunsTess(files = NULL, writetable = FALSE, sorttable = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character vector of TESS cluster files to be tabulated. On windows, use \code{choose.files(multi = TRUE)} for interactive selection. Use \code{collectRunsTess()} to collect TESS runs from multiple folders into one.}

\item{writetable}{A logical indicating if output table must be exported as a tab-delimited text file in the same folder as the STRUCTURE run files.}

\item{sorttable}{A logical indicating if output table is to be sorted. Sorts table by ind and K.}

\item{quiet}{A logical indicating if a message showing the number of selected files is displayed. The message is supressed if set to T.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with filenames, K and number of individuals of all runs sorted by ind and K (if sorttable = T).
}
\description{
Creates a table from TESS output files with filenames, K and number of individuals.
}
\details{
The row numbers of the output table denotes the file number selected. This is helpful if a particular file from the table needs to be identified in the selection vector.
