\title{Tabulate STRUCTURE runs}
\usage{
tabulateRunsStructure(files = NULL, writetable = FALSE, sorttable = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character or vector of STRUCTURE output files to be tabulated. On windows, use \code{choose.files(multi = TRUE)} for interactive selection.}

\item{writetable}{A logical TRUE or FALSE. Set to FALSE by default. Setting to TRUE writes the output table to the working directory.}

\item{sorttable}{A logical indicating if the output table needs to be sorted. Default set to TRUE. Sorts table by loci, ind and K.}

\item{quiet}{A logical TRUE or FALSE. Set to FALSE by default to print number of selected files. If set to TRUE, then number of selected files are not printed.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with all runs sorted by loci, ind and K (if sorttable = T). The table has 9 columns namely file name, value of K, number of individuals, number of loci, estimated ln probability of data, mean value of ln likelihood, variance of ln likelihood, number of burn-in and number of repeats. Missing values are given NA.
The row numbers of the output table denotes the file number selected. This is helpful if a particular file from the table needs to
be identified in the selection vector.
}
\description{
Creates a table from STRUCTURE output files with various STRUCTURE parameters. Refer to return for detailed list of columns.
