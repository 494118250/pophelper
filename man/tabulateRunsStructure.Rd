\usage{
  tabulateRunsStructure(files = NULL, writetable = F,
    quiet = F)
}
\arguments{
  \item{files}{A character vector of STRUCTURE output files
  to be tabulated. Use \code{choose.files(multi=TRUE)} for
  interactive selection.}

  \item{writetable}{Set to F by default. Setting to T
  writes the output table as a tab-delimited text file in
  the working directory.}

  \item{quiet}{Set to F by default to print number of
  selected files. If set to T, then number of selected
  files are not printed.}
}
\value{
  Returns a dataframe with all runs sorted by K. The table
  has 10 columns namely file name, value of K, Number of
  individuals, Number of loci, Estimated ln probability of
  data, Mean value of ln likelihood, Variance of ln
  likelihood, Mean value of alpha, Number of burn-in and
  Number of repeats. Missing values are given NA.
}
\description{
  Creates a table from STRUCTURE output files with various
  STRUCTURE parameters. Refer to return for detailed list
  of columns.
}
\details{
  The row numbers of the output table denotes the file
  number selected. This is helpful if a particular file
  from the table needs to be identified in the selection
  vector.
