\title{Combine TESS runs and export files for use with software CLUMPP}
\usage{
clumppExportTess(files = NULL, prefix = NA, parammode = NA,
  paramrep = NA, useexe = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character vector of TESS cluster run files to be tabulated. 
Use \code{choose.files(multi = TRUE)} for interactive selection.}

\item{prefix}{A character prefix for folder names. By default, set to 'TESSpop'.}

\item{parammode}{A numeric 1, 2 or 3 indicating the algorithm option for CLUMPP paramfile. Calculated 
automatically by default. Set this value to 3 if CLUMPP runs too long. See details.}

\item{paramrep}{A numeric indicating the number of repeats for CLUMPP paramfile. Calculated 
automatically by default. See details.}

\item{useexe}{A logical indicating if CLUMPP executable must be run automatically based on system OS (experimental). See details.}
}
\value{
The combined file and paramfile are written into respective folders 
named by population.
}
\description{
Takes multiple TESS runs and combines several repeats for each 
K into a single file along with a parameter file. The two output files are 
organised into folders by K. The CLUMPP executable file can simply be copied to this 
folder and run to reorder the clusters for each K.
}
\details{
When multiple repeats are run for each K in TESS, the order of 
clusters may be jumbled for each run. Therefore, when plotting multiple runs 
within each K, the colours cannot be assigned correctly. The software CLUMPP 
helps to overcome this issue by reordering the clusters correctly. This 
function clumppExportTess() takes multiple runs for each K and combines 
them into a single file and generates a parameter file for easy use with 
CLUMPP. Further details for CLUMPP can be found here: Jakobsson, M., and 
Rosenberg, N. A. (2007). CLUMPP: a cluster matching and permutation program 
for dealing with label switching and multimodality in analysis of population 
structure. Bioinformatics, 23(14), 1801-1806.\cr
\cr
The parammode (M) is the type of algorithm used. Option 1 is 'FullSearch' 
(takes the longest time), option 2 is 'Greedy' and option 3 is 'LargeKGreedy'
(fastest). If clumpp takes more than a few minutes, consider changing parammode
to a higher number (ex. from 2 to 3), or open the exported paramfile and manually
change GREEDY_OPTION to 3.\cr
\cr
The parammode and paramrep for CLUMPP paramfile is set based on this calculation.
T <- factorial(k)*((runs*(runs-1))/2)*k*ind, where k is number of 
populations, runs is number of runs for k and ind is number of individuals.
If T <= 100000000, then parammode is 2 and paramrep is 20, otherwise 
parammode is 3 and paramrep is set to 500.\cr
\cr
To find out more about parammode (algorithm type) and paramrep (repeats), 
refer to CLUMPP documentation.\cr

\strong{useexe}\cr
This option automatically runs the CLUMPP executable that is provided with this package. 
The CLUMPP executable was obtained from \url{https://web.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/clumpp.html}.
Remember to cite CLUMPP if this option is used.
