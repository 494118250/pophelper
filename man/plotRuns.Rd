\usage{
plotRuns(files = NULL, imgoutput = "sep", poplab = NA, popcol = NA,
  na.rm = FALSE, imgtype = "png", height = NA, width = NA, dpi = NA,
  units = NA, flabsize = NA, flabcol = NA, flabbackcol = NA,

}
\arguments{
  \item{files}{One or more STRUCTURE/TESS/table files}

  \item{imgoutput}{Options are 'sep','join' or'tab'.If
  output="sep", STRUCTURE/TESS run files are plotted as
  separate image files. If output="join", STRUCTURE/TESS
  run files are joined into a single image. If
  output="tab", combined/aligned/merged files are plotted
  into separate or joined plots based on number of tables
  within each file.}

  \item{poplab}{A character vector of population labels
  equal to length of individuals. Each pop name must repeat
  to the number of individuals present in each pop.}

  \item{popcol}{A vector of colours (representing
  populations) for colouring clusters. If NA, colours are
  automatically generated. K 1 to 12 are custom unique
  colours while K>12 are coloured by function
  rich.color().}

  \item{na.rm}{Default set to FALSE. NAs are not removed
  from data, therefore ggplot prints warning messages for
  NAs. If set to TRUE, NAs are removed before plotting and
  ggplot NA warning is suppressed.}

  \item{imgtype}{Image file type. Possible options are
  "png","jpeg" or "pdf". For pdf, height and width are in
  inches and res does not apply.}

  \item{height}{Height of individual run plot. By default,
  automatically generated based on number of Individuals.
  Ranges between 2.5cm and 4.6cm.}

  \item{width}{Width of individual run plot. By default,
  automatically generated based on number of individuals.
  Ranges between 5cm and 30cm.}

  \item{dpi}{Image resolution. Defaults to 300.}

  \item{units}{Units of height and width. Default set to
  "cm". If type is eps, units must be "in".}

  \item{flabsize}{The size of the filename label. Defaults
  to 4.}

  \item{flabcol}{The colour of the filename label. Defaults
  to "grey10".}

  \item{flabbackcol}{The background colour of the filename
  label. Defaults to white}

  \item{labpos}{The y position of the labels.}

  \item{labsize}{Size of the labels.}

  \item{labangle}{Angle/Rotation of labels. 0 is horizontal
  while 90 is vertical.}

  \item{labjust}{Justification of labels. Defaults to 0.5
  if labangle=0 or 1 if labangle between 20 and 135.}

  \item{labcol}{Colour of labels. Defaults to "grey30".}

  \item{pointsize}{Size of points on label marker line.}

  \item{pointcol}{Colour of the points on the label marker
  line. Defaults to "grey30".}

  \item{pointtype}{Type of points on the label marker line.
  Defaults to |.}

  \item{linepos}{The y position of the label marker line
  and the points.}

  \item{linethick}{Thickness of the label marker line.}

  \item{linecol}{Colour of the label marker line. Defaults
  to "grey30".}

  \item{fmar}{Figure margins in 'lines' unit. A vector of 4
  numbers for top, right, bottom and left margins. ex.
  c(0.2,0.2,0.2,0).}

Nothing is returned.

\description{
Plot one or more STRUCTURE/TESS output files or table files
(aligned/combined/merged) files. The STRUCTURE and TESS
files can be plotted individually or joined together. The
table files will be plotted based on number of runs in each
file.
}
\details{
It is possible to set either height or width and leave
other as default.
