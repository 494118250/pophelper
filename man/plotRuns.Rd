plotRuns(files = NULL, imgoutput = "sep", poplab = NA, popcol = NA,
  na.rm = TRUE, imgtype = "png", height = NA, width = NA, dpi = NA,
  units = NA, panelspacer = NA, flab = TRUE, flabsize = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character vector of one or more STRUCTURE/TESS/table files}

\item{imgoutput}{A character with options: 'sep','join' or'tab'.If set to "sep", STRUCTURE/TESS run files are plotted as separate image files. If set to "join", STRUCTURE/TESS run files are joined into a single image. If set to "tab", combined/aligned/merged files are plotted into separate or joined plots based on number of tables within each file.}

\item{poplab}{A character vector of population labels equal to length of individuals. Each pop name must repeat to the number of individuals present in each pop.}

\item{popcol}{A vector of colours (representing populations) for colouring clusters. If NA, colours are automatically generated. K=1 to 12 are custom unique colours while K>12 are coloured by function rich.color().}

\item{na.rm}{A logical indicating if NAs are removed from data, else \code{ggplot} prints warning messages for NAs. If set to TRUE, NAs are removed before plotting and \code{ggplot} NA warning is suppressed.}

\item{imgtype}{A character indicating image file type. Possible options are "png","jpeg" or "pdf". For pdf, height and width are in inches and res does not apply.}

\item{height}{A numeric indicating the height of individual run plot. By default, automatically generated based on number of Individuals. Ranges between 2.5cm and 4.6cm.}

\item{width}{A numeric indicating the width of individual run plot. By default, automatically generated based on number of individuals. Ranges between 5cm and 30cm.}

\item{dpi}{A numeric indicating the image resolution in pixels per inch (PPI). Defaults to 300.}

\item{units}{A numeric indicating the units of height and width. Default set to "cm".}

\item{panelspacer}{A numeric indicating the space at the bottom of one or more barplot panels.}

\item{flab}{A logical indicating if strip panels on right side must be shown. Strip panels display file name and K value. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{flabsize}{A numeric indicating the size of the filename label. Defaults to 4. Applicable only if flab=T.}

\item{flabcol}{A colour character indicating the colour of the filename label. Defaults to "grey10". Applicable only if flab=T.}

\item{flabbackcol}{A colour character denoting the background colour of the filename label. Defaults to white. Applicable only if flab=T.}

\item{labspacer}{A numeric indicating the space between the plots and the label area. Applicable only with population labels.}

\item{labpanelheight}{A numeric indicating the height of the label area in cm. Default is 0.4 cm. If units are different, cm will be be converted automatically. Applicable only with population labels.}

\item{labpos}{A numeric indicating the y position of the labels. Applicable only with population labels.}

\item{labsize}{A numeric indicating the size of the labels.}

\item{labangle}{A numeric indicating the angle/rotation of labels. 0 is horizontal while 90 is vertical.}

\item{labjust}{A numeric indicating the justification of labels. Defaults to 0.5 if labangle = 0  or 1 if labangle between 20 and 135.}

\item{labcol}{A colour character for the colour of labels. Defaults to "grey30".}

\item{pointsize}{A numeric indicating the size of points on label marker line.}

\item{pointcol}{A colour character for the colour of points on the label marker line. Defaults to "grey30".}

\item{pointbgcol}{A colour character for the background of marker point for certain pointtypes.}

\item{pointtype}{A character or number for the type of points on the label marker line. Defaults to |. Same as pch in standard R.}

\item{linepos}{A numeric indicating the y position of the label marker line and the points.}

\item{linethick}{A numeric indicating the thickness of the label marker line.}

\item{linecol}{A colour character for the label marker line. Defaults to "grey30".}

\item{linetype}{A numeric indicating the type of line for marker line. Same as lty in standard R. Default value is 1.}

\item{div}{A logical indicating if divider lines between population clusters must be drawn. Applicable only with population labels.}

\item{divcol}{A character or hexadecimal colour denoting the colour of the divider line. Default is white.}

\item{divtype}{A numeric indicating the type of line for the divider line. Same as lty in standard R. Default value is 1.}

\item{divthick}{A numeric indicating the thickness of the divider line. Default is 0.25}

\description{
Plot one or more STRUCTURE/TESS output files or table files (aligned/combined/merged) files. The STRUCTURE and TESS files can be plotted individually or joined together. The table files will be plotted based on number of runs in each file.
}
\details{
It is possible to set either height or width and leave other as default.
