\arguments{
\item{datafile}{One STRUCTURE, TESS or MATRIX output file. Input is either a character
or a dataframe. If character, then a path pointing to location of the datafile. Can use
\code{choose.files()}. If a dataframe, then an output from \code{runsToDfStructure()},
\code{runsToDfTess()} or \code{runsToDfMatrix()}.}

\item{coordsfile}{A character or a dataframe. If character, then a path pointing
to location of the coordsfile. It must be a tab-delimited text file with x and y
coordinates of the samples. The number of rows must be equal to the number of
samples in datafile. The coordsfiles must have no header and 2 columns in the
order: x (latitude) and then y (longitude). Coordinates must be in standard
longitude latitude (LL) decimals.}

\item{method}{A character indicating the method employed for interpolation. Options are "bilinear",
"bicubic", "krig" (Kriging), "idw" (Inverse distance weighting) or "nn" (nearest
neighbour). See Details for more information.}

\item{duplicate}{A character indicating how to deal with duplicate spatial locations. This is only
applicable to 'bilinear' and 'bicubic' methods. Options are "error" (error message
if duplicate points), "strip" (remove all duplicate points), "mean" (mean of
duplicate points), "median" (median of duplicate points).}

\item{idwpower}{A numeric indicating the power of inverse distance weighting if method is set to "idw".}

\item{clusters}{A numeric or numeric vector indicating the clusters to plot. If NA, all clusters are plotted. For ex.
If set to 2, cluster 2 is plotted. If set to 2:4, clusters 2, 3 and 4 are plotted.
If set to c(1,4,5), clusters 1, 4 and 5 are plotted.}

\item{gridsize}{A numeric indicating the size of the image grid on which interpolation is to be carried
out. Set to 60 by default. Higher values produces less pixelated grids, but more
computationally intensive.}

\item{imgoutput}{A character. To plot each cluster as a seperate figure, set to "sep". To plot
multiple clusters in a single figure, set to "join". If number of clusters is less
than 2, then automatically set to "sep".}

\item{colours}{A vector of colours. R colour names or hexadecimal values. Set to
9 value 'Blues' palette from RColorBrewer by default.}

\item{nrow}{A numeric indicating the number of rows of plots in a joined plot. Determined automatically
if number of plots <20 and \code{nrow = NA}.}

\item{ncol}{A numeric indicating the number of columns of plots in a joined plot. Determined automatically
if number of plots <20 and \code{ncol = NA}.}

\item{exportplot}{A logical. If set to FALSE, no image is exported.}

\item{imgtype}{A character indicating the export format for figures. Options are "png", "jpeg" or "pdf".
If pdf, height and width must be in inches and res argument is ignored (set to 300).}

\item{height}{A numeric indicating the height of export figure in cm unless units are changed.}

\item{width}{A numeric indicating the width of export figure in cm unless units are changed.}

\item{units}{A character indicating units of measurement for figure dimensions. Set to 'cm' by default.}

\item{res}{A numeric indicating the pixel resolution of the export image. Set to 200 by default.}

\item{showaxis}{A logical. If TRUE, then axis text, axis ticks and plot border are plotted.}

\item{addpoints}{A logical. If TRUE, then sample coordinates are overplotted on interpolated grid.}

\item{pointcol}{Colour of sample points. An R colour or hexadecimal value.}

\item{pointtype}{The shape/pch of sample points. A numeric or a character.}

\item{pointsize}{The size of sample points. A number usually 0.4,0.8,1,3 etc.}

\item{legend}{A logical. If TRUE, the legend for the colours is plotted.}

\item{legendpos}{A character of 2-value numeric vector indicating the position of the legend. If "right","left","top" or "bottom", then,
legend is plotted outside the plot area. To plot inside plot area use a 2 vale vector.
If a vector like c(1,1), first value denotes x-axis from 0 to 1 and second value
denotes y-axis from 0 to 1. For ex. to plot in bottom left corner, use c(0,0).}

\item{legendjust}{The x and y axis justification of the legend. A 2 value vector.}

\item{legendsize}{A numeric indicating the size of the legend in cm. Usually values like 0.5,0.7,1.2 etc.
The legendsize does not control the text in the legend.}

\item{legendtextsize}{A numeric indicating the size of the text in the legend.}

\item{dataout}{A logical. If set to TRUE, a list of one or more \code{ggplot} gtable elements are returned.
This output can be modified using \code{ggplot} themes() for more figure control if required.}
}
\value{
If \code{dataout = TRUE}, a list of one or more \code{ggplot} gtable output is returned for more theme
control if required.

\description{
Interpolate clusters from STRUCTURE, TESS or MATRIX runs spatially using coordinates.
}
\details{
The "bilinear", "bicubic", "idw" and "nn" are essentially direct interpolation
between spatial points. The "krig" option is predictive rather than direct interpolation.
The kriging function is same function provided by the TESS authors in their R script.
The function uses great circle distances \code{rdist.earth()} from \code{fields} package to
determine theta. Therefore coordinates must be in LL and not UTM.
For more details of methods, see R package \code{akima} function \code{interp} for "bilinear"
and "bicubic" methods, see R package \code{fields} function \code{Krig} for "krig" method, see
R package \code{spatstat} function \code{idw} for "idw" and function \code{nnmark} for "nn" method.
The model for "krig" is automatically determined and may produce warning messages if
the GCV algorithm does not converge optimally. This shouldn't be an issue for exploratory
analyses. All methods require full coordinate data. No missing data allowed in coordsfile.
