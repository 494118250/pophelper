\item{linepos}{A numeric indicating the y position of the label marker line and the points. Applicable only with group labels. Defaults to 1.}

\item{linethick}{A numeric indicating the thickness of the label marker line. Default range between 0.3 and 0.6 depending on number of individuals.}

\item{linecol}{A colour character for the label marker line. Defaults to "grey30".}

\item{linetype}{A numeric indicating the type of line for marker line. Same as lty in standard R. Default value is 1.}

\item{linealpha}{A numeric between 0 and 1 denoting transparency of the marker line. Defaults to 1.}

\item{div}{A logical indicating if divider lines between groups must be drawn. Applicable only when group labels are in use.}

\description{
Generate separate or joined barplots (group-level) from qlists.
}
\details{
\strong{height}\cr
Argument \code{height} denotes the height of one run panel. With joined plots, the \code{height} is multiplied by number of runs. The height does not include label panel. The \code{labpanelheight} is used to define the full height of the lab panel. If \code{labpanelheight} is not provided, it is calculated based on the number of group label sets.
final_image_height = (height*num_of_runs)+labpanelheight
It is possible to set either height or width and leave other as default.\cr

\strong{sortind}\cr
This argument takes one character as input.  Default NA means individuals are plotted in the same order as input. Individuals can be ordered by one cluster. For ex. \code{sortind="Cluster1"} or \code{sortind="Cluster2"}.
To order by all clusters as the 'Sort by Q' option in STRUCTURE software, use \code{sortind="all"}. When using \code{sortind} with \code{subsetgrp}, individuals
are sorted within the groups.\cr

\strong{grplab}\cr
\code{grplab} must be a list. One or more label sets can be provided. Each 
label set must be a character vector equal to the number of individuals 
present in the qlist. 
For example, we can provide one set of grp labels as such:\cr
\code{labs1 <- c("Pop A","Pop A","Pop B","Pop B")}\cr
\code{grplab=list("grp"=labs1)}\cr

A second set of grp labels can be provided as such:
\code{labs2 <- c("Loc 1","Loc 1","Loc 2","Loc 3")}\cr
\code{grplab=list("population"=labs1,"location"=labs2)}\cr

\strong{subsetgrp}\cr
This argument takes one or more characters as input. Use only group labels used in the \code{grplab} vector. For ex. In case of two grps in order 'Pop A' and 'Pop B',
use \code{subsetgrp=c("Pop B","Pop A")} to change order of groups. Use \code{subsetgrp="Pop B"} to subset only Pop B.\cr
