\title{Combine STRUCTURE runs and export files for use with software CLUMPP}
\usage{
  clumppExportStructure(files = NULL, prefix = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{files}{A character vector of STRUCTURE output files
  to be tabulated. Use choose.files(multi=TRUE) for
  interactive selection.}

  \item{prefix}{A character prefix for folder names.}
}
\value{
  The combined file and paramfile are written into
  respective folders named by population. A tabulated table
  is returned from function same as
  tabulateRunsStructure().
}
\description{
  Takes multiple STRUCTURE runs and combines several
  repeats for each K into a single file along with a
  parameter file. The two output files are organised into
  folders by K. The CLUMPP.exe file can simply be copied to
  this folder and run to reorder the clusters for each K.
}
\details{
  When multiple repeats are run for each K in STRUCTURE,
  the order of clusters may be jumbled for each run.
  Therefore, when plotting multiple runs within each K, the
  colours cannot be assigned correctly. The software CLUMPP
  helps to overcome this issue by reordering the clusters
  correctly. This function clumppExportStructure() takes
  multiple runs for each K and combines them into a single
  file and generates a parameter file for easy use with
  CLUMPP. Further details for CLUMPP can be found here:

  cluster matching and permutation program for dealing with
  label switching and multimodality in analysis of
  population structure. Bioinformatics, 23(14), 1801-1806.
