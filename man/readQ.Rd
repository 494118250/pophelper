\title{Convert run files (q-matrices) to qlist.}
\usage{
readQ(files = NULL, filetype = "auto", indlabfromfile = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character or character vector of one or more files.}

\item{filetype}{A character indicating input filetype. Options are 'auto','structure','tess',
'basic' or 'clumpp'. See details.}

\item{indlabfromfile}{A logical indicating if individual labels must be read 
from input file and used as row names for resulting dataframe. Spaces in 
labels may be replaced with _. Currently only applicable to STRUCTURE runs files.}
}
\value{
A list of lists with dataframes is returned. List items are named by input filenames.
File extensions such as '.txt','.csv','.tsv' and '.meanQ' are removed from filename.
In case filenames are missing or not available, lists are named sample1, sample2 etc.
For STRUCTURE runs, if individual labels are present in the run file and \code{indlabfromfile=T}, 
they are added to the dataframe as row names. Structure metadata including loci, 
burnin, reps, elpd, mvll, and vll is added as attributes to each dataframe.
For CLUMPP files, multiple runs within one file are suffixed by -1, -2 etc.
}
\description{
Takes one or more STRUCTURE, TESS, numeric delimited run files or 
CLUMPP format files and converts them to a qlist (list of dataframes).
}
\details{
STRUCTURE and TESS run files have unique layout and format (See vignette). BASIC files can be Admixture run files, 
fastStructure meanQ files or any tab-delimited, space-delimited or comma-delimited tabular data 
without a header. CLUMPP files can be COMBINED, ALIGNED or 
MERGED files. COMBINED files are generated from \code{clumppExport}. ALIGNED and 
MERGED files are generated by CLUMPP.

To convert TESS3 R objects to pophelper qlist, see \code{\link{readQTess3}}.

See the \href{http://royfrancis.github.io/pophelper/}{vignette} for more details.
