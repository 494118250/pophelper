pophelper 1.0.4
===========
* 18-May-2014
* Cairo plotting for png exports. Better anti-aliasing.
* fig aspect ratio issue fixed in plotRunsInterpolate()
* Namespace error resolved for some functions.
* Minor changes to plotRunsInterpolate().
* plotRunsSpatial() function added. STRUCTURE and TESS runs can be used with a coordinate file to spatially plot the points and colour them into clusters based on the highest probability value. The coordinates can be transformed to UTM coordinates for a better spatial representation.

pophelper 1.0.3
