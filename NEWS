pophelper 1.1.2
===========
* 17-Sep-2015
* Error fixed in evannoMethodStructure() when using writetable=T
Error in vapply(x, format, "", ...) : values must be length 1,
 but FUN(X[[1]]) result is length 6
* Same error fixed in tabulateRunsStructure()
* Same error fixed in tabulateRunsTess()
* Same error fixed in summariseRunsStructure()
* Same error fixed in summariseRunsTess()
* Error fixed in plotRunsInterpolate()
Error in theme(legend.key.size = unit(legendsize, "cm")) : 
  could not find function "unit"

pophelper 1.1.1
===========
* 31-Mar-2015
* Function plotRuns() modified.
    + Spacing between bottom plot and second plot was larger than spacing between other plots. This has been corrected.
    + New code to plotting labels
    + Arguments to control label panel height (labpanelheight), spacing between plots (panelspacer), spacing between label area and plots (labspacer).
    + Argument to include or exclude side panels on right side (flab).
    + Argument to include a divider line between populations (flab). Further arguments to modify the divider line.
    + Figure dimensions and conversions have been improved. Old dimension settings (length, height, res etc) may give different plot dimension in this version.
* Internal helper functions for plotRuns() modified.
* Function evannoMethodStructure() modified.
    + Argument doplot is removed. Set plot off using exportplot=F.
    + Argument basesize added to generally control size of figure elements.
    + Conversion between units and dimensions have been modified.

pophelper 1.1.0
===========
* 16-Mar-2015
* Several changes in code to enable faster runtime.
* New HTML vignette created.
* Corrections to NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION
* Function tabulateRunsStructure() modified.
* Function tabulateRunsTess() modified.
* Function summariseRunsStructure() function modified. 2.5x faster.
    + ddply() from plyr() package used to summarise table.
    + na.rm argument added for summarising table. na.rm is passed to min(), max(), mean() and sd() functions.
    + Output table variable order changed. Current column order is loci, ind, k, runs, elpdmean, elpdsd, elpdmin, elpdmax.
* Function summariseRunsTess() function modified.
    + Function ddply() from plyr() package used to summarise table.
    + Output table variable order changed. Current column order is ind, k, runs.
* evannoMethodStructure() has an improved plot theme.
* Function plotRuns() modified.
    + Argument 'labcol' didn't change colour of labels. Fixed.
    + Argument 'pointbgcol' added for background colour of marker points
    + Argument 'linetype' added for changing line type of marker line
* Function analyseRuns() function added. A wrapper for several other functions. Performs a tabulation of runs, summarising of runs, perform Evanno method (for STRUCTURE runs only), exports clumpp output and generates barplots.

pophelper 1.0.4
===========
* 18-May-2014
* Cairo plotting for png exports. Better anti-aliasing.
* fig aspect ratio issue fixed in function plotRunsInterpolate()
* Namespace error resolved for some functions.
* Minor changes to plotRunsInterpolate().
* plotRunsSpatial() function added. STRUCTURE and TESS runs can be used with a coordinate file to spatially plot the points and colour them into clusters based on the highest probability value. The coordinates can be transformed to UTM coordinates for a better spatial representation.

pophelper 1.0.3
===========  
* 11-May-2014
* Function plotRunsInterpolate() added. STRUCTURE and TESS run files can be used with a coordinate file to spatially interpolate clusters using several interpolation methods such as thin splines, inverse distance weighting and kriging.

pophelper 1.0.2
===========  
* 25-Apr-2014
* A bug in functions clumppExportStructure() and clumppExportTess() produced a 'No input' error. This has been fixed. Thanks to Micheal Panasci for pointing this out.

pophelper 1.0.1
===========  
* parameter sorttable added to functions tabulateRunsStructure() and tabulateRunsTess(). Useful if unsorted table is required.

pophelper 1.0.0
===========  
* completed 16-Feb-2014
* the first version of the `pophelper` package
