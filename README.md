Also, try the short video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOqxXcQReJI).

## Installation  
You need to have R (> 3.0.0) installed on your system. Then, install the 'devtools' package. Then, you can install `pophelper` from `github` using the `devtools` package.

```coffee
install.packages('devtools',dep=T)
require(devtools)
install_github('pophelper', 'royfrancis')
require(pophelper)
```
For help on any function, use  
`?tabulateRunsStructure`  
`?evannoMethodStructure`

For functions where one or more files need to be selected, the selection can be performed interactively. Windows users can use `choose.files(multi=T)`. Mac users can use `file.choose()` for single selection and `tk_choose.files()` from `tcltk` package for multiple selection.

## Functions and workflow 
A list of important functions are shown below. Once the package is installed, and you have set a working directory, you can follow the mini tutorial below.

### 1. Tabulate runs  
Select multiple STRUCTURE or TESS runs and tabulate them into a table.

```coffee
#read sample STRUCTURE files from R package
flist<-list.files(path=system.file("/files/structure",package="pophelper"),full.names=T)
#read sample TESS files from R package
flist1<-list.files(path=system.file("/files/tess",package="pophelper"),full.names=T)
#Or select your own files
flist<-choose.files()

#tabulate STRUCTURE runs
df<-tabulateRunsStructure(files=flist)
#tabulate TESS runs
tabulateRunsTess(files=flist1)
```
### 2. Summarise runs  
The tabulated runs can be further condensed by repeats.

```coffee
#summarise STRUCTURE runs
df1<-summariseRunsStructure(df)
summariseRunsTess()
```

### 3. Evanno method  
This function calculates the Evanno derivatives, tables and figures. The output from `summariseRunsStructure()` can be provided as input.

```coffee
#perform evanno method
evannoMethodStructure(df1)
```

__Fig 1.__ Evanno Method

### 4. Convert to dataframe  
STRUCTURE and TESS run files can be converted to R dataframes using this function. If multiple files are selected, then a list of dataframes is returned.

```coffee
#convert STRUCTURE run files to R dataframe
runsToDfStructure(files=flist)

#convert TESS run files to R dataframe
runsToDfTess(files=flist1)
```
### 5. Generate CLUMPP output  
This function can be used to create files for use with CLUMPP. The function creates a combined file and paramfile in separate directories by K.

```coffee
#convert STRUCTURE runs for CLUMPP
clumppExportStructure(files=flist)

#convert TESS runs for CLUMPP
clumppExportTess(files=flist1)
```

![CLUMPP results aligned file merged file and misc file](screenshots/Fig4.jpg)  
__Fig 3.__ Folder showing CLUMPP results: aligned file, merged file and misc file.

### 6. Collect CLUMPP output files  
The CLUMPP output files are created in multiple folders. This function helps to collect aligned files, merged files or both from multiple directories into a single directory. 

To follow this function in this tutorial, you will need to manually run CLUMPP.exe in each directory.

```coffee
#collect CLUMPP outputs into single directory
collectClumppOutput(prefix="STRUCTUREpop", filetype="both")  
collectClumppOutput(prefix="TESSpop", filetype="both")
```

### 7. Plot run files  
This function is used to plot barplots from STRUCTURE files, TESS files, combined files, aligned files or merged files.

* To plot separate files from STRUCTURE/TESS files  

```coffee
#plot separate figures
plotRuns(files=flist[1:2]) 
#plot separate figures
plotRuns(files=flist[1:2], imgoutput="sep")
```

* To plot joined files from STRUCTURE/TESS files  

```coffee
#plot joined figures
plotRuns(files=flist[1:2], imgoutput="join")
```

![plotRuns example 1](screenshots/Fig5.jpg)  
__Fig 4.__ Left: Single run plotted separately. Right: Two runs joined together in one image.  

* To plot with populations labels 

```coffee
#read labels for STRUCTURE
pops<-read.delim(system.file("files/structurepoplabels.txt",package="pophelper"),header=F)

#plot separately with labels
plotRuns(files=flist[1:2], imgoutput="sep", poplab=pops$V1) 
#plot joined with labels
plotRuns(files=flist[1:2], imgoutput="join", poplab=pops$V1) 

#create TESS labels
labs1 <- factor(c(rep("PopA",30),rep("PopB",45)))

#plot TESS runs with labels
plotRuns(files=flist1[1:2], imgoutput="sep", poplab=labs1) 
plotRuns(files=flist1[1:2], imgoutput="join", poplab=labs1) 
```

![plotRuns example 2](screenshots/Fig6.jpg)  
__Fig 5.__ Left: Single run plotted separately with pop labels. Right: Two runs joined together in one image with pop labels.

* To plot only joined files from table files (combined/aligned/merged)  

```coffee
#read table files
tabs1<-c(system.file("files/STRUCTUREpop_K4-combined.txt",package="pophelper"),
          system.file("files/STRUCTUREpop_K4-combined-aligned.txt",package="pophelper"),
          system.file("files/STRUCTUREpop_K4-combined-merged.txt",package="pophelper"))

#plot table files
plotRuns(files=tabs1, imgoutput="tab")
```

![PlotRuns example 3](screenshots/Fig7.jpg)  
__Fig 6.__ Left: Combined files (Three STRUCTURE runs for K=4). Middle: Aligned files (Three STRUCTURE runs for K=4 aligned using CLUMPP). Right: Merged file (Three runs for K=4 merged into one table/figure using CLUMPP).

### 8. Plot Multiline  
This function is also used to create barplots from STRUCTURE, TESS or table files. The output is created as A4 format by default. The barplot is broken down to multiple rows to enable easier identification of individuals. The number of samples per line (`spl`) and number of lines per page (`lpp`) can be defined manually if required.

```coffee
#plot multiline
plotMultiline(files=flist[1]) 
plotMultiline(files=flist1[1]) 

#plotmultiline with custom setting
plotMultiline(files=flist[1], spl=75, lpp=10)
plotMultiline(files=flist1[1], spl=75, lpp=11)
```
![plotMultiline example](screenshots/Fig11.jpg)  
__Fig 7.__ Left: `plotMultiline` default output. Right: Modified output where `spl` and `lpp` were defined manually.

__Fig 8.__ Multiline plots with (left) standard colours, (middle) `rich.colors()` from `gplots` package and (right) `brewer.pal(8,"Spectral")` from `RColorBrewer` package.


### 9. Collect TESS runs
TESS run files are generated from TESS into multiple folders. These file can be collect into a single folder using this function. 

```coffee
#collect TESS runs from multiple directories into one
collectRunsTess(runsdir = choose.dir())
```

### 10. Plot Interpolation  
This function allows to spatially interpolate STRUCTURE and TESS clusters. Files needed are STRUCTURE or TESS run files and geographical coordinate files of same length. Note that the coordinate file must be tab-delimited text file with no headers. The first column must be x (latitude) and second column y (longitude). Note that none of the methods are able to handle missing coordinate data. All coordinates must be available.

```coffee
#specify path for datafile and coordsfile
flist1<-list.files(path=system.file("/files/tess",package="pophelper"),full.names=T)
df1 <- flist1[2]
cd1 <- system.file("/files/coords75.txt",package="pophelper")
#basic usage
plotRunsInterpolate(datafile=df1,coordsfile=cd1)
#adjusting legend size and legend text
plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.4,legendtextsize=6)
```
The default interpolation algorithm is Kriging (`method="krig"`). By default, `exportplot=T` which exports an image to the working directory. By default `clusters=NA` which means that all clusters in the file are plotted. By default, `imgoutput="join"`, therefore all clusters are plotted in a single figure.

![Interpolation sample 1](screenshots/Fig13.jpg)  

__Fig 9.__ Interpolated plot of one TESS run file containing 6 clusters (K=6). The default interpolation algorithm (method) used was kriging. In this particular case, it is known that K=2, therefore only cluster 2 has useful information.

We can choose only cluster 2 and try out different interpolation methods. Five methods are currently implemented: bilinear, bicubic, inverse distance weighting, nearest neighbour and kriging. Kriging is predictive while others are essentially direct spatial interpolation.

```coffee
p1<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.3,legendtextsize=5,clusters=2,dataout=T,method="bilinear",exportplot=F)
p2<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.3,legendtextsize=5,clusters=2,dataout=T,method="bicubic",exportplot=F)
p3<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.3,legendtextsize=5,clusters=2,dataout=T,method="idw",exportplot=F)
p4<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.3,legendtextsize=5,clusters=2,dataout=T,method="nn",exportplot=F)
p5<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,legendsize=0.3,legendtextsize=5,clusters=2,dataout=T,method="krig",exportplot=F)

png("MethodsComparison.png",height=16,width=22,res=200,units="cm",type="cairo")
grid.arrange(p1[[1]],p2[[1]],p3[[1]],p4[[1]],p5[[1]],nrow=2,ncol=3)
dev.off()
```
We specify `clusters=2` which plots only cluster 2. The `dataout=T` allows to save the ggplot plot object to a variable and then modify them or combine with other plots. Due to `exportplot=F`, no plots are exported.

__Fig 10.__ Interpolated plot of one cluster (Cluster 2) one TESS run file containing 6 clusters (K=6) showing different interpolation methods. Row 1 from left: bilinear, bicubic and Inverse distance weighting. Row 2 from left: Nearest neighbour and Kriging.

The colours can be easily changed by feeding in required colours to the argument `colours`. The R package `RColorBrewer` has a wide range of nice colours. The clusters to plot can be defined using the argument `clusters`.

```coffee
#view Colorbrewer colours
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all()

#sample plots with custom colours
p1<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,clusters=2:3,colours=brewer.pal(8,"RdYlBu"),legend=F,exportplot=F,dataout=T)
p2<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,clusters=2,colours=brewer.pal(8,"Spectral"),legend=F,exportplot=F,dataout=T)
p3<-plotRunsInterpolate(datafile,coordsfile,clusters=2,colours=rev(brewer.pal(8,"BuPu")),legend=F,exportplot=F,dataout=T)
png("PlotColours.png",height=8,width=24,res=200,units="cm",type="cairo")
grid.arrange(p1[[1]],p1[[2]],p2[[1]],p3[[1]],ncol=4)
dev.off()
```
