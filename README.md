# pophelper 2.1.0

`pophelper` is an R package and web app to analyse and visualise population structure. `pophelper` curently supports output run files generated from population analysis programs such as STRUCTURE, TESS and numeric delimited formats such as ADMIXTURE or fastSTRUCTURE. The `pophelper` package can be used to read run files to R, tabulate runs, summarise runs, estimate *K* using the Evanno method, export files for CLUMPP, export files for DISTRUCT and generate barplot figures.  

For a detailed demonstration and walkthrough, refer the online [vignette](http://royfrancis.github.io/pophelper/). A quick intro video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyo-88g9dDg). New versions and updates are shown only on this GitHub page.

## Latest version

This version 2.1.0 no longer supports any of the functions deprecated in version <2.0.0. `ggplot2` version must be 2.2.0 or above. Some of the important changes from the previous version 2.0.0 are listed below:

+ Order of arguments have changed in `plotQ()`,`plotQMultiline()` and `evannoMethodStructure()`
+ `plotQMultiline()`: Group labels, sorting within groups, subsetting groups, reordering groups etc
+ `plotQMultiline()`: Sorting by individual labels
+ `plotQ()`: Sorting by individual labels
+ More plot customisation arguments added to `evannoMethodStructure()`
+ tiff export added to all export functions
+ Argument 'barwidth' replaced with 'barsize'
+ Argument 'linethick' replaced with 'linesize'
+ Argument 'divthick' replaced with 'divsize'
+ Argument 'res' replaced with 'dpi'

For full list of changes, refer to the [NEWS](https://github.com/royfrancis/pophelper/blob/master/NEWS).

## Installation  
You need to have R (> 3.3.0) statistical package installed on your system. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is open-source and freely available to download for Windows, Mac and other OS. Then, install the `devtools` and other dependency packages. Then, you can install `pophelper` from `github` using the `devtools` package.  

```coffee
# install dependencies and devtools
install.packages(c("Cairo","ggplot2","gridExtra","gtable","tidyr","devtools"),dependencies=T)

# load package
library(devtools)

# install pophelper package from GitHub
install_github('royfrancis/pophelper')

# load library for use
library(pophelper)
```

Note that `pophelper 1.2.0` and later includes binary executables for CLUMPP and DISTRUCT. This is experimental and may not work on all OS and versions.

`pophelper 2.1.0` has been tested on the following systems: 

+ Windows 10 64bit, R 3.3.3
+ Windows 7 64bit, R 3.3.3 (DISTRUCT is unstable)
+ Scientific Linux 6.8 (Carbon) 64bit, R 3.3.2

## Web App   
An online interactive version of pophelper is available at [pophelper.com](http://www.pophelper.com). Not all features of the R package is supported in the online app.  

## List of Functions  

For help on any function, use  
`?tabulateQ`  
`?evannoMethodStructure`  

```coffee
readQ()                   # Read q-matrix run files to R qlist
tabulateQ()               # Tabulate a qlist
summariseQ()              # Summarise an output from tabulateQ()
clumppExport()            # Generate CLUMPP input/output files
collectClumppOutput()     # Collect CLUMPP output into a common directory
plotQ()                   # Create single-line barplots from qlist
PlotQMultiline()          # Create multi-line barplots from qlist
distructExport()          # Export files for DISTRUCT from qlist

evannoMethodStructure()   # Perform the Evanno method for STRUCTURE data
collectRunsTess()         # Collect TESS output from multiple directories into one

analyseQ()                # A wrapper function to quickly tabulate, summarise, 
                          # perform evanno method, clumpp output and generate
                          # barplots from filenames/paths.
```
