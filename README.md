# pophelper 1.1.4

`pophelper` is an R package to help analyse output files generated from population analysis programs such as STRUCTURE and TESS. The `pophelper` package can be used to tabulate runs, summarise runs, estimate K using the Evanno method, export files for CLUMPP, generate barplot figures, spatial plots and interpolation using geographical coordinates. 

For a detailed demonstration, refer the [vignette](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78814791/sites/pophelpervignette/vignette_v112.html). Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcQHvdPK8df1p_ZtpHOs9hUj6aNR670j_) to watch video tutorials. New versions and updates are shown only on this GitHub page.

## Installation  
You need to have R (> 3.1.0) statistical package installed on your system. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is open-source and freely available to download for Windows, Mac and other OS. Then, install the 'devtools' package. Then, you can install `pophelper` from `github` using the `devtools` package.

```coffee
install.packages('devtools',dep=T)
library(devtools)

#for the current stable version, use
install_github('royfrancis/pophelper')

#load library for use
library(pophelper)
```
__Web App__  
An online interactive version of pophelper is now available at [pophelper.com](http://www.pophelper.com).

## List of Functions  
  
For help on any function, use  
`?tabulateRunsStructure`  
`?evannoMethodStructure`  

For functions where one or more files need to be selected, the selection can be performed interactively. Windows users can use `choose.files(multi=T)`. Mac users can use `file.choose()` for single selection and `tk_choose.files()` from `tcltk` package for multiple selection.  


```coffee
tabulateRunsStructure()   # Get a tabulation of several STRUCTURE files
summariseRunsStructure()  # Summarise runs by repeats for each K
evannoMethodStructure()   # Perform the Evanno method on summarised data
runsToDfStructure()       # Convert STRUCTURE run files to R dataframe
clumppExportStructure()   # Export data file and parameter file for use with CLUMPP

collectRunsTess()         # Collect TESS output from multiple folders into one
tabulateRunsTess()        # Get a tabulation of several TESS files
summariseRunsTess()       # Summarise runs by repeats for each K
runsToDfTess()            # Convert TESS run files to R dataframe
clumppExportTess()        # Export data file and parameter file for use with CLUMPP

collectClumppOutput()     # Collect CLUMPP output into a common folder
plotRuns()                # Plot a barplot from STRUCTURE/TESS/table files
PlotMultiline()           # Plot a multi-line barplot from STRUCTURE/TESS/table file
plotRunsInterpolate()     # Spatially interpolate clusters from a STRUCTURE/TESS run file
plotRunsSpatial()         # Cluster by max assignment and plot points spatially

analyseRuns()             # A wrapper function to quickly tabulate, summarise, perform evanno method, 
                            clumpp output and generate barplots from STRUCTURE or TESS run files.
```

## Functions and workflow 

![Workflow Structure](vignettes/WorkflowScheme-01.jpg)  
__Fig 1.__ *Workflow for STRUCTURE files. Files/objects are indicated in black text and functions are indicated in blue. The analyseRuns() function is a wrapper function which can be used to run several functions together. This is indicated by the asterisk and the orange path. For clumpp results, the clumpp executable must be run to continue with the workflow.*

![Workflow Tess](vignettes/WorkflowScheme-02.jpg)  
__Fig 2.__ *Workflow for TESS files. Files/objects are indicated in black text and functions are indicated in blue. The analyseRuns() function is a wrapper function which can be used to run several functions together. This is indicated by the asterisk and the orange path. For clumpp results, the clumpp executable must be run to continue with the workflow.*

![Interpolation sample 1](vignettes/Fig10.jpg)  

__Fig 12.__ *Interpolated plot of one TESS run file containing 6 clusters (K=6). The default interpolation algorithm (method) used was kriging. In this particular case, it is known that K=2, therefore only cluster 2 has useful information.*
